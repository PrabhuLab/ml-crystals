Title: Tools to Extract Data from CIF Files for Crystallography
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Don Ngo <dngo@carnegiescience.edu>

Description: Provides a suite of functions to parse Crystallographic Information
    Files (.cif), extracting essential data such as chemical formulas, unit cell
    parameters, atomic coordinates, and symmetry operations. It also includes
    tools to calculate interatomic distances, identify bonded pairs using various
    algorithms (Minimum Distance, Brunner's, Hoppe's), determine nearest
    neighbor counts, and calculate bond angles. The package is designed to
    facilitate the preparation of crystallographic data for further analysis,
    including machine learning applications in materials science.
