\title{Calculate Weighted Average Network Distance (Site-Centric)}
\usage{
calculate_weighted_average_network_distance(
  distances,
  atomic_coordinates,
  wyckoff_symbols
)
}
\arguments{
\item{distances}{A \code{data.table} of interatomic distances. Must contain \code{Atom1}
and \code{Distance} columns. \code{Atom1} must contain labels like 'Ga1', 'Ge1', etc.}

\item{atomic_coordinates}{A \code{data.table} from \code{extract_atomic_coordinates}
containing Wyckoff, multiplicity, and label information.}

\item{wyckoff_symbols}{A character vector of the full Wyckoff symbols
(e.g., "4c", "24k") that define the atomic network to be analyzed.}
}
\value{
A single numeric value for the weighted average distance.
}
\description{
Calculates a weighted average distance for a specified atomic network,
correctly handling disordered crystallographic sites.
}
\details{
The function follows a site-centric approach. First, it identifies
all unique crystallographic sites (e.g., '6c', '16i') within the network.
For each unique site, it calculates the average interatomic distance to its
neighbors. The final network average is then computed by taking a weighted
mean of these per-site averages, where the weight for each site is its
Wyckoff multiplicity. This method correctly handles cases where a single
crystallographic site is co-occupied by multiple elements (disorder).
